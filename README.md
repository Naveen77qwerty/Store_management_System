Store Management System (Java)

A simple Java-based Store Management System that manages products, customers, staff, and orders. Built with Object-Oriented Programming principles, it provides a foundation for handling common store operations such as billing, discounts, and entity validation.

ðŸ‘¥ Customer & Staff Management â€“ maintain customer records and staff details using Customer, Staff, and Person classes.

ðŸ›’ Order Processing â€“ create and manage orders via Order.

ðŸ’³ Billing & Discounts â€“ apply discount values through the Billing interface.
